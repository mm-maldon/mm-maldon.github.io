# Malachi Maldonado's Website
## https://mm-maldon.github.io

This is my website, hosted on GitHub pages. It includes some basic info about me, some images I like, and background music that can 
be turned on and off with a button.

### Why is it so basic?
This is my first project on GitHub. I'll be improving it as I continue to gain more experience in HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript.
